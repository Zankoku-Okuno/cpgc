Fixup

Platform Dependence
	assumption of 64-bit machine
	use of gcc __builtin_ctzll
	assuming aligned to whatever malloc aligns to is good enough
		this assumption could get worse with the nursery

Performance
	choose gcptrs block to fit nicely
	fast alocator for gcptr blocks
	profile whether to use single word for info-less gc

Test
	custom trace functions
	finalizers

Document

Literate Documentation
	Allocation

Configuration
	when to trigger major cleanup
	nursery size

Cool Features
	force-collect an object, leaving a tombstone
		tombstone just means the data pointer is NULL
