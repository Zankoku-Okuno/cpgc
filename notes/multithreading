engines have no locks, and so must be used single-threading
to enable communication between threads, you'll need to have some sort of channel:
	the channel locks
	the source thread copies data into the channel
	the source and sink synchronize
	the sink thread grabs the data (either copies or takes ownership, depending on the channel)
the channel may itself have some form of garbage collection

this doesn't solve passing data to a child thread by closure
could be done by setting current closure as a root, or by copying current closure, or some form of analysis
